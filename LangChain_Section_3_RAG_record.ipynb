During the nineteenth century, nationalism emerged as a\\nforce which brought about sweeping changes in the political and\\nmental world of Europe. The end result of these changes was the\\nemergence of the nation-state in place of the multi-national dynastic\\nempires of Europe. The concept and practices of a modern state, in\\nwhich a centralised power exercised sovereign control over a clearly\\ndefined territory, had been developing over a long period of time\\nin Europe. But a nation-state was one in which the majority of its\\ncitizens, and not only its rulers, came to develop a sense of common\\nidentity and shared history or descent. This commonness did not\\nexist from time immemorial; it was forged through struggles, through\\nthe actions of leaders and the common people.

The lecture  was\\nsubsequently published as a famous essay entitled\\n‘Qu’est-ce qu’une nation?’ (‘What is a Nation?’).\\nIn this essay Renan criticises the notion suggested\\nby others that a nation is formed by a common\\nlanguage, race, religion, or territory:\\n‘A nation is the culmination of a long past of\\nendeavours, sacrifice and devotion. A heroic past,\\ngreat men, glory, that is the social capi tal upon\\nwhich one bases a national idea.

The ideas of la patrie  (the\\nfatherland) and le citoyen (the citizen) emphasised\\nthe notion of a united community enjoying equal rights under a\\nconstitution. A new French flag, the tricolour,   was chosen to replace\\nthe former royal standard. The Estates General  was elected by the\\nbody of active citizens and renamed the National Assembly. New\\nhymns were composed, oaths taken and martyrs commemorated,\\nall in the name of the nation. A centralised administrative system\\nwas put in place and it f ormulated uniform laws for all citizens\\nwithin its territory. Internal customs duties and dues were abolished\\nand a unif orm system of  weights and measur es was adopted.\\nRegional dialects were discouraged and French, as it was spoken\\nand written in Paris, became the common language of the nation.\\nThe revolutionaries further declared that it was the mission and the\\ndestiny of the French nation to liberate the peoples of Europe\\nfrom despotism, in other words to help other peoples of Europe\\nto become nations.\\nWhen the news of the events in France reached the different cities\\nof Europe, students and other members of educated middle classes\\nbegan setting up J acobin clubs. Their activities and campaigns\\nprepared the way for the French armies which moved into Holland,\\nBelgium, Switzerland and much of  Italy in the 1790s.

Eastern and Central Europe were under\\nautocratic monarchies within the territories of which lived diverse\\npeoples. They did not see themselves as sharing a collective identity\\nor a common culture. Often, they even spoke different languages\\nand belonged to different ethnic groups. The Habsburg Empire\\nthat ruled over Austria-Hungary, for example, was a patchwork of\\nmany different regions and peoples. It included the Alpine regions\\n– the Tyrol, Austria and the Sudetenland – as w ell as Bohemia,\\nwhere the aristocracy was predominantly German-speaking. It also\\nincluded the Italian-speaking provinces of Lombardy and Venetia.\\nIn Hungary, half of the population spoke Magyar while the other\\nhalf spoke a variety of dialects. In Galicia, the aristocracy spoke\\nPolish. Besides these three dominant groups, there also lived within\\nthe boundaries of the empire, a mass of subject peasant peoples –\\nBohemians and Slovaks to the north, Slovenes in Carniola, Croats\\nto the south, and R oumans to the east in Transylvania.

This powerful aristocracy was,\\nhowever, numerically a small group. The majority of the population\\nwas made up of the peasantry.

Industrialisation began in England in the second\\nhalf of the eighteenth century, but in France and parts of the German\\nstates it occurred only during the nineteenth century. In its wake,\\nnew social groups came into being: a working-class population, and\\nmiddle classes made up of industrialists, businessmen, professionals.\\nIn Central and Eastern Europe these groups were smaller in number\\ntill late nineteenth century. It was among the educated, liberal middle\\nclasses that ideas of national unity following the abolition of\\naristocratic privileges gained popularity.\\n2.2 What did Liberal Nationalism Stand for?\\nIdeas of national unity in early-nineteenth-century Europe were closely\\nallied to the ideology of  liberalism. The term ‘liberalism’ derives\\nfrom the Latin root liber, meaning free. For the new middle classes\\nliberalism stood for freedom for the individual and equality of all\\nbefore the law . Politically, it emphasised the concept of go\\nvernment\\nby consent. Since the French Revolution, liberalism had stood for\\nthe end of autocracy and clerical privileges, a constitution and\\nrepresentative government through parliament. Nineteenth-century\\nliberals also stressed the inviolability of private property.\\nYet, equality before the law did not necessarily stand for universal\\nsuffrage. You will recall that in revolutionary France, which marked\\nthe first political experiment in liberal democracy, the right to vote\\nand to get elected was granted exclusively to property-owning men.\\nMen without property and all women were excluded from political\\nrights. Only for a brief period under the Jacobins did all adult males\\nenjoy suffrage. However, the Napoleonic Code went back to limited\\nsuffrage and reduced women to the status of a minor, subject to\\nthe authority of fathers and husbands. Throughout the nineteenth\\nand early twentieth centuries women and non-propertied men\\norganised opposition movements demanding equal political rights.\\nIn the economic sphere, liberalism stood for the freedom of markets\\nand the abolition of state-imposed restrictions on the movement\\nof goods and capital. During the nineteenth century this was a strong\\ndemand of the emerging middle classes. Let us take the example of\\nthe German-speaking regions in the first half  of  the nineteenth\\ncentury.

Secret societies sprang\\nup in many European states to train revolutionaries and spread\\ntheir ideas.

As a young man of 24, he was\\nsent into exile in 1831 for attempting a revolution in Liguria.\\nHe subsequently founded two more underground societies,\\nfirst, Young Italy in Marseilles, and then, Young Europe in\\nBerne, whose members were like-minded young men from\\nPoland, France, Italy and the German states. Mazzini believed\\nthat God had intended nations to be the natural units of\\nmankind. So Italy could not continue to be a patchwork of\\nsmall states and kingdoms. It had to be forged into a single\\nunified republic within a wider alliance of nations. This\\nunification alone could be the basis of Italian liberty. Following\\nhis model, secret societies were set up in Germany, France,\\nSwitzerland and Poland. Mazzini’s relentless opposition to\\nmonarchy and his vision of democratic republics frightened the\\nconservatives.

Whi le both of them studied la w,\\nthey soon developed an interest in collecting old\\nfolktales. They spent six years travelling from\\nvillage to village, talking to people and writing\\ndown fairy tales, which were handed down\\nthrough the generations. These were popular\\nboth among children and adults. In 1812, they\\npublished their first collection of tales.\\nSubsequently, both the br others became activ e\\nin liberal politics, especially the movement\\nfor freedom of the press. In the meantime they\\nalso published a 33-volume dictionary of the\\nGerman language.\\nThe Grimm brothers also saw French domination\\nas a threat to German culture, and believed that\\nthe folktales they had collected were expressions\\nof a pure and authentic German spirit. They\\nconsidered their projects of collecting folktales\\nand developing the German language as part of\\nthe wider effort to oppose French domination\\nand create a German national identi ty.\\nThe emphasis on vernacular language and the collection of local\\nfolklore was not just to recover an ancient national spirit, but also to\\ncarry the modern nationalist message to large audiences who were\\nmostly illiterate.\\n This was especially so in the case of Poland, which\\nhad been partitioned at the end of the eighteenth century by the\\nGreat Powers – Russia, Prussia and Austria. Even though Poland no\\nlonger existed as an independent territory\\n, national feelings were kept\\nalive through music and language. Karol Kurpinski, for example,\\ncelebrated the national struggle through his operas and music, turning\\nfolk dances like the polonaise and mazurka into nationalist symbols.\\nLanguage too played an important role in developing nationalist\\nsentiments. After Russian occupation, the Polish language was forced\\nout of schools and the Russian language was imposed everywhere.\\nIn 1831, an armed rebellion against Russian rule took place which\\nwas ultimately crushed. Following this, many members of the clergy\\nin Poland began to use language as a weapon of national resistance.\\nPolish was used for Church gatherings and all religious instruction.\\nAs a result, a large number of priests and bishops were put in jail or\\nsent to Siberia by the Russian authorities as punishment for their\\nrefusal to preach in Russian. The use of Polish came to be seen as a\\nsymbol of the struggle against Russian dominance.\\n3.2 Hunger, Hardship and Popular Revolt\\nThe 1830s were years of great economic hardship in Europe. The\\nfirst half  of the nineteenth century saw an enormous increase in\\npopulation all over Europe. In most countries there were more\\nseekers of  jobs than emplo yment. Population from r ural areas\\nmigrated to the cities to live in overcrowded slums. Small producers\\nin towns were often faced with stiff competition from imports of\\ncheap machine-made goods from England, where industrialisation\\nwas more advanced than on the continent. This was especially so in\\ntextile production, which was carried out mainly in homes or small\\nworkshops and was only partly mechanised. In those regions of\\nEurope where the aristocracy still enjoyed power, peasants struggled\\nunder the burden of feudal dues and obligations.\\n The rise of food\\nprices or a year of  bad har vest led to widespr ead pauperism in\\ntown and country.\\nThe year 1848 was one such year.

All of these ethnic groups had their own cultural\\nand political traditions. But as the English nation steadily grew in\\nwealth, importance and power, it was able to extend its influence\\nover the other nations of the islands.

The Act of Union\\n(1707) between England and Scotland that resulted in the formation\\nof the ‘United Kingdom of Great Britain’ meant, in effect, that\\nEngland was able to impose its influence on Scotland.

            "Giuseppe Mazzini was an Italian revolutionary born in Genoa in 1805. He became a member of the secret society of the Carbonari and was sent into exile in 1831 at the age of 24 for attempting a revolution in Liguria. Mazzini subsequently founded two more underground societies: Young Italy in Marseilles and Young Europe in Berne. He believed that nations were intended by God to be the natural units of mankind and advocated for the unification of Italy into a single republic as part of a wider alliance of nations. Mazzini's vision opposed monarchy and supported democratic republics, which frightened conservatives. Metternich described him as \"the most dangerous enemy of our social order.\"\n",

            "The Gutenberg press, developed by Johann Gutenberg in the 1430s, was an innovative printing technology that utilized movable type. Drawing inspiration from the olive press, Gutenberg designed a system where metal types were cast for each letter of the alphabet, allowing for the composition of different texts. By 1448, Gutenberg had perfected this system, and the first major book he printed was the Bible, producing around 180 copies over three years. This was considered fast for the time. The press could print 250 sheets on one side per hour. This technology initiated a print revolution, leading to a significant increase in book production across Europe, with 20 million copies by the end of the 15th century and 200 million by the 16th century. Initially, printed books closely resembled handwritten manuscripts, with spaces left for hand-drawn illustrations and decorations.\n",
